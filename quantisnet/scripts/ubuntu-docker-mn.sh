Docker setup completed. We will now ask for your masternode details to create
a docker-compose file you can use to start your masternodes. This file will be
created inside a folder called "quantisnet-mn" in the directory where you ran the 
setup script - $(pwd)

Setup complete. You can now start your node(s) with: 

cd quantisnet-mn
docker-compose up -d

Alias commands for all your masternodes have been installed. To run a command
inside your masternode, just call it with its name. For example, if you want 
to run getinfo inside your masternode "mn1", run this command:

mn1 getinfo
